## Basic Resource Generation

You start with the following blocks on your platform however you must pick them up and place them back down again for them to function. There are 2 main blocks. On the left is the Random Ore Generator (Placement) and on the right is the Raw Conversion Generator.

### Random Ore Generator (Placement)

Will generate 1 random ore above it for you to mine. Mine the ore away to generate another random ore. Use this mechanic to get at least 1 of a raw ore that you desire then use that raw ore in the Raw Conversion Generator. There is an upgraded version of this block that will produce an item in its inventory instead of placing a block in the world. This would be available once you obtain Steel Ingots.

### Raw Conversion Generator

Insert a raw ore of any kind and it will generate a corresponding ore above it for you to mine. There is an upgraded version of this block that will produce an item in its inventory instead of placing a block in the world. This would be available once you obtain Steel Ingots.
